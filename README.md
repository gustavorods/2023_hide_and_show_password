# Project Documentation: Web Password Show and Hide System

## Overview

This project aims to implement a common functionality in web applications that allows users to toggle the visibility of their passwords while typing. This feature is often represented by an icon and is widely used in login forms and other areas that involve password input.

<br/>

## Functionality

### What is it?

It is a feature present on almost every website, enabling users to view or hide the password they are entering. This provides greater flexibility and control to the user during the password entry process.

### How does it work?

Within the page, the user types their password (or any desired text) and has the option to display or hide the password using a designated button for this function. Usually, this option is represented by an icon rather than text.

<br/>

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore and understand the implementation of this function in web code, as well as to allow practical testing of its operation on the web.

<br/>

## Technologies Used

Throughout the development process, the following programming and markup languages were employed:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
